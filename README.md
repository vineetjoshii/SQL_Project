# SQL_Project
Hello all, This is my first SQL Project. This project is on employee dataset which has different attributes. Having an interest in SQL, I have decided to make a simple project. To begin with, I was not clear about the dataset and the background to work on. I had various datasets in my mind after browsing through a lot of examples. Each dataset I viewed at was looking friendly but selecting one has taken a while. After looking at various datasets and projects, I came to know about 'Kaggle'. I explored Kaggle, looked at several sets, and finally ended up choosing the set that looked very familiar to me. I have downloaded the dataset and started exploring different scenarios as to how different statements can be formed.

Dataset 1 - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/sf-salaries
Dataset 2 - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset

Challenges-
1. After downloading the first dataset, I noticed that it had 148k records. Here was a challenge. Importing this huge set into MySQL was not easy. It was taking a lot of time to import the set into MySQL. I explored different ways and watched videos. There are a few techniques for importing huge datasets into MySQL but I was not able to relate as these techniques included the use of Python which I was not aware of. I still watched videos, and read the suggestions but couldn't make it. An idea struck my mind, I reduced the number from 148k to 10k which is when I was able to import the set real fast.
2. After working on the first set for a while, I needed another set that should relate to the first. Here is when I encountered another challenge. I explored various sets but none corresponded to the first. I then found a set on Kaggle which was making sense when I looked at both the sets. I then altered the second set as per the requirements.
